# CSI102-Listas-Java
In this repository, I'm going to upload some Java exercises I made for my Programming class. These are beginner programs, by the way!

# About
Salutations, stranger!
As my other repositories, these exercises are just a simple introduction to the language, so it's going to be very useful for those who are starting programming in Java.


## Content
All exercise lists have a specific theme to exercise. By the time, here they are:
- **Lista 1:** Methods, Objects;
- **Lista 2:** Aggregation, Composition, Encapsulation;
- **Lista 3:** Heritage and Hierarchy;
- **Lista 4:** Polymorphism and Overwriting;
- **Lista 5:** Collections and Exceptions;
- **Lista 6:** Singleton, Abstract Factory, Factory Method and Adapter.

## Observations:
Most exercises are in Portuguese, with just a few terms in English. I intend to pass them definetely to English.

## References
All codes are from my CSI102 - Computer Programming II classes from Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto (UFOP).
They are made by me, but the exercises are my professor's RAFAEL FREDERICO ALEXANDRE!
